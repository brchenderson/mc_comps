					<h1>Photographs from Detroit: Survival, renewal and urban farming</h1>
					<p>Erica Yoon visited Detroit in October 2012 to investigate urban gardening initiatives for a project as a graduate student in photojournalism at Ohio University. The idea of urban farms popping up amid the chaos in Detroit seemed to be a great way to visualize how people were attempting to weather the economic storm there. She spent ten days meeting people, photographing and trying to parse what she’d read about Detroit from what she was hearing from people on the ground.</p>
					<p>“I realized early on that I couldn’t just focus on the process of urban gardening anymore,” writes Yoon. “Urban gardening alone was not going to fix the problems of the economically strained in Detroit. But instead, it became much more about all of the different people and communities who were working towards this momentum of change.”</p>

Since 2006 the neighborhood has experienced a turn around that began with a youth market garden started by Sheila Hoerauf and Riet Schumack as a way to "fight blight, drug trafficking and prostitution on Grayfield and to provide a healthy space for local children." Since then the Brightmoor Farmway has been established, an area that incorporates over 20 parks and gardens in a 14-block area. <span class="photographer">Photo by Erica Yoon</span></figcaption>

D-Town Farm is part of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network and began seven years ago in 2006 on the west side of Detroit. Volunteers can come to help work on the farm, where a majority of the produce is then sold back into the community at farmer's markets. <span class="photographer">Photo by Erica Yoon</span></figcaption>

Miller and his horses plowed through garlic plots on harvest day at the school. Miller hopes that the horses can stable closer to the city to do farm chores and provide educational outings in the city on a regular basis. Catherine Ferguson Academy is a school devoted for young mothers and mothers-to-be in Detroit. Farming Mothers is a club recently established to expose students to agricultural business. There are currently 200 students enrolled in the school. <span class="photographer">Photo by Erica Yoon</span></figcaption>

"I feel like something needs to change in this country and there's a lot of people getting together talking about how we can affect that change and I think it's really important," participant Marsha Spencer of Wixom, Mich. said. About 200 people attended the event at Grand Circus Park, according to Erik Shelly, a member of the Occupy Detroit Media Team. <span class="photographer">Photo by Erica Yoon</span></figcaption>
